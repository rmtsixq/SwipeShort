ShortSwipe
Project Overview
ShortSwipe is a platform where users can transform long videos or films into short clips. The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use platform for users to upload and share bite-sized video content, bringing quick laughs, cool moments, or simply something new every time you swipe.

Currently, only the homepage layout has been implemented. The design for the homepage is functional but without active features at the moment.

Features (Planned)
Drag and Drop Upload: Users will be able to drag and drop their video files into the platform.

YouTube URL Input: Users can paste YouTube links to automatically fetch videos.

Short Video Creation: Users will be able to select a video and trim it into short clips.

Swipe Interface: Swipe through quick, bite-sized videos.

Current Status

Next Steps
