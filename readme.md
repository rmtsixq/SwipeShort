# SwipeShort

PLEASE READ FULLY ShortSwipe is a modern movie and series watching platform for free without any ads (EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY). Users can make friends on the site, message them, and even share the movies they like! The unique catch is this platform is designed for the ones who can't find what to watch; well... now it's EASY! Just go to the Discover section to scroll through film trailers and find one easily. Couldn't find it? Just use the movieBOT; it's a bot that finds the movies you like. Just tell him what you like! (He is shy a lil bit.) Before I explain, I want to be upfront:
The project is for educational purposes only.
It does not host or store any movie files.
All videos are pulled through third-party APIs and embedded.
Why tf I Built This?
I was curious about how movie sites actually work and wanted to explore their flaws. My idea was to create a cleaner, ad-free interface and experiment with API integration.And they wanted us to make 100 hour project in neighborhood event and they let my ass do some pirate shit.
Along the way, I realized something important:
Without content, these kinds of sites are meaningless and boring
With content, they raise serious legal and ethical issues.
My Position
I donâ€™t support piracy.
I built this to learn about API usage, scraping, and frontend/backend integration.
If anything here seems like piracy, the responsibility lies with the third-party API providers, not this project.
Looking back, I might not have chosen this exact path if I had understood the seriousness from the start. But I also donâ€™t regret the 100+ hours I put in â€” it was a huge learning experience.lol
Thanks for understanding, and I hope people see this project for what it really is
